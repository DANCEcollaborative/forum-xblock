Features
--------

Did someone say features?

* Cross-platform: Windows, Mac, and Linux are officially supported.

* Works with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, and PyPy. *(But you don't have to know/write Python
  code to use Cookiecutter.)*

* Project templates can be in any programming language or markup format:
  Python, JavaScript, Ruby, CoffeeScript, RST, Markdown, CSS, HTML, you name
  it. You can use multiple languages in the same project template.

* Simple command line usage:

    .. code-block:: bash

        # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template
        # You'll be prompted to enter values.
        # Then it'll create your Python package in the current working directory,
        # based on those values.
        $ cookiecutter https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage
        # For the sake of brevity, repos on GitHub can just use the 'gh' prefix
        $ cookiecutter gh:audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage

* Can also use it at the command line with a local template:

    .. code-block:: bash

        # Create project in the current working directory, from the local
        # cookiecutter-pypackage/ template
        $ cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypackage/

* Or use it from Python:

    .. code-block:: python

        from cookiecutter.main import cookiecutter

        # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage/ template
        cookiecutter('cookiecutter-pypackage/')

        # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template
        cookiecutter('https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git')

* Directory names and filenames can be templated. For example::

    {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}.py

* Supports unlimited levels of directory nesting.

* 100% of templating is done with Jinja2. This includes file and directory names.

* Simply define your template variables in a `cookiecutter.json` file. For example:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "full_name": "Audrey Roy",
            "email": "audreyr@gmail.com",
            "project_name": "Complexity",
            "repo_name": "complexity",
            "project_short_description": "Refreshingly simple static site generator.",
            "release_date": "2013-07-10",
            "year": "2013",
            "version": "0.1.1"
        }

* Unless you suppress it with `--no-input`, you are prompted for input:

  - Prompts are the keys in `cookiecutter.json`.
  - Default responses are the values in `cookiecutter.json`.
  - Prompts are shown in order.

* Cross-platform support for `~/.cookiecutterrc` files:

    .. code-block:: YAML

        default_context:
            full_name: "Audrey Roy"
            email: "audreyr@gmail.com"
            github_username: "audreyr"
        cookiecutters_dir: "~/.cookiecutters/"

* Cookiecutters (cloned Cookiecutter project templates) are put into
  `~/.cookiecutters/` by default, or cookiecutters_dir if specified.

* You can use local cookiecutters, or remote cookiecutters directly from Git
  repos or from Mercurial repos on Bitbucket.

* Default context: specify key/value pairs that you want used as defaults
  whenever you generate a project

* Direct access to the Cookiecutter API allows for injection of extra context.

* Pre- and post-generate hooks: Python or shell scripts to run before or after
  generating a project.

* Paths to local projects can be specified as absolute or relative.

* Projects are always generated to your current directory.

Community
---------

The core committer team is `@audreyr`_, `@pydanny`_, `@michaeljoseph`_, and
`@pfmoore`_. We
welcome you and invite you to participate.

Stuck? Try one of the following:

* See the `Troubleshooting`_ page.
* Ask for help on `Stack Overflow`_.
* You are strongly encouraged to `file an issue`_ about the problem, even if
  it's just "I can't get it to work on this cookiecutter" with a link to your
  cookiecutter. Don't worry about naming/pinpointing the issue properly.
* Ask for help in #cookiecutter if you must (but please try one of the other
  options first, so that others can benefit from the discussion)

Development on Cookiecutter is community-driven:

* Huge thanks to all the `contributors`_ who have pitched in to help make
  Cookiecutter an even better tool.
* Everyone is invited to contribute. Read the `contributing instructions`_,
  then get started.

Connect with other Cookiecutter contributors and users in IRC:

* #cookiecutter on irc.freenode.net (note: due to work and commitments,
  a core committer might not always be available)

Encouragement is unbelievably motivating. If you want more work done on
Cookiecutter, show support:

* Thank a core committer for their efforts.
* Star `Cookiecutter on GitHub`_.
* Join the `Cookiecutter Gittip community`_.

Got criticism or complaints?

* `File an issue`_ so that Cookiecutter can be improved. Be friendly
  and constructive about what could be better. Make detailed suggestions.
* **Keep us in the loop so that we can help.** For example, if you are
  discussing problems with Cookiecutter on a mailing list, `file an issue`_
  where you link to the discussion thread and/or cc at least 1 core committer on
  the email.
* Be encouraging. A comment like "This function ought to be rewritten like
  this" is much more likely to result in action than a comment like "Eww, look
  how bad this function is."

Waiting for a response to an issue/question?

* Be patient and persistent. All issues are on the core committer team's radar and
  will be considered thoughtfully, but we have a lot of issues to work through. If
  urgent, it's fine to ping a core committer in the issue with a reminder.

0.7.0 (2013-11-09)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a release with significant improvements and changes. Please read
through this list before you upgrade.

New features:

* Support for --checkout argument, thanks to `@foobacca`_.
* Support for pre-generate and post-generate hooks, thanks to `@raphigaziano`_.
  Hooks are Python or shell scripts that run before and/or after your project
  is generated.
* Support for absolute paths to cookiecutters, thanks to `@krallin`_.
* Support for Mercurial version control system, thanks to `@pokoli`_.
* When a cookiecutter contains invalid Jinja2 syntax, you get a better message
  that shows the location of the TemplateSyntaxError. Thanks to `@benjixx`_.
* Can now prompt the user to enter values during generation from a local
  cookiecutter, thanks to `@ThomasChiroux`_. This is now always the default
  behavior. Prompts can also be supressed with `--no-input`.
* Your cloned cookiecutters are stored by default in your `~/.cookiecutters/`
  directory (or Windows equivalent). The location is configurable. (This is a
  major change from the pre-0.7.0 behavior, where cloned cookiecutters were
  deleted at the end of project generation.) Thanks `@raphigaziano`_.
* User config in a `~/.cookiecutterrc` file, thanks to `@raphigaziano`_.
  Configurable settings are `cookiecutters_dir` and `default_context`.
* File permissions are now preserved during project generation, thanks to
  `@benjixx`_.

Bug fixes:

* Unicode issues with prompts and answers are fixed, thanks to `@s-m-i-t-a`_.
* The test suite now runs on Windows, which was a major effort. Thanks to 
  `@pydanny`_, who collaborated on this with me.

Other changes:

* Quite a bit of refactoring and API changes.
* Lots of documentation improvements. Thanks `@sloria`_, `@alex`_, `@pydanny`_,
  `@freakboy3742`_, `@es128`_, `@rolo`_.
* Better naming and organization of test suite.
* A `CookiecutterCleanSystemTestCase` to use for unit tests affected by the
  user's config and cookiecutters directory.
* Improvements to the project's Makefile.
* Improvements to tests. Thanks `@gperetin`_, `@s-m-i-t-a`_.
* Removal of `subprocess32` dependency. Now using non-context manager version
  of `subprocess.Popen` for Python 2 compatibility.
* Removal of cookiecutter's `cleanup` module.
* A bit of `setup.py` cleanup, thanks to `@oubiga`_.
* Now depends on binaryornot 0.2.0.

.. _`@sloria`: https://github.com/sloria/

0.6.2 (2013-08-19)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Depend on Jinja2>=2.4 instead of Jinja2==2.7.
* Fix errors on attempt to render binary files. Copy them over from the project
  template without rendering.
* Fix Python 2.6/2.7 `UnicodeDecodeError` when values containing Unicode chars
  are in `cookiecutter.json`.
* Set encoding in Python 3 `unicode_open()` to always be utf-8.

0.6.1 (2013-08-12)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Improved project template finding. Now looks for the occurrence of `{{`,
  `cookiecutter`, and `}}` in a directory name.
* Fix help message for input_dir arg at command prompt.
* Minor edge cases found and corrected, as a result of improved test coverage.

0.6.0 (2013-08-08)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Config is now in a single `cookiecutter.json` instead of in `json/`.
* When you create a project from a git repo template, Cookiecutter prompts
  you to enter custom values for the fields defined in `cookiecutter.json`.

0.5 (2013-07-28)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Friendlier, more simplified command line usage::

    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage/ template
    $ cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypackage/

    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template
    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git

* Can now use Cookiecutter from Python as a package::

    from cookiecutter.main import cookiecutter

    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage/ template
    cookiecutter('cookiecutter-pypackage/')

    # Create project from the cookiecutter-pypackage.git repo template
    cookiecutter('https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git')

* Internal refactor to remove any code that changes the working directory.

0.4 (2013-07-22)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Only takes in one argument now: the input directory. The output directory
  is generated by rendering the name of the input directory.
* Output directory cannot be the same as input directory.

0.3 (2013-07-17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Takes in command line args for the input and output directories.

0.2.1 (2013-07-17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Minor cleanup.

0.2 (2013-07-17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bumped to "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha".

* Works with any type of text file.
* Directory names and filenames can be templated.
